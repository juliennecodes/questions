//QUESTION
//in strict mode, *this* holds the value of undefined in functions that are not called as methods
//I might have more questions about this statement after I write a few examples

//QUESTION
let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand");
console.log(name);
//returns
// Ferdinand
// undefined
//returns an undefined value and created the global binding *name*

//?? what exactly is happening?
//I think I get undefined because the lines of code don't resolve to anything
//what is the Ferdinand line though?
